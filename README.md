# password-checker
This my first Major python project!

# About the project
Its a small app that runs through the CLI, all it does so far is checks your passwords for things such as: Special Characters, Upper & Lowercase, Numbers & Password Length.

The more of those checks you pass the better your score is (upto 5)!
